Section 1 –  
Sight Systems – Point of 
Aim 
What does Point of Aim mean? 
It’s exactly what you would expect, it is where your sights are aligned on the target. This could be directly zeroed for 
the centre of the target or just below it. Here’s an example with iron sights: 
Six O’clock Hold 
Centre Hold 
 
 
When you are conducting a zero process, the point of aim is the basis of your calculations for adjustment later. It is 
extremely important NOT to change your point of aim when building a group on a target. 
Why? 
 
Altering your point of aim will create multiples of groups and you will chase errors when zeroing 
 
It’ll cost you more money in ammo! 
When creating a group, always fire at least three rounds. If there are any obvious flyers (see Appendix), continue to fire 
but MAINTAIN THE SAME POINT OF AIM! 
If you have a flyer, fire another round or two and this will give you a clear picture of how your firearm is grouping.

How to adjust sights–Iron 
Iron Sight Adjustment 
As discussed previously, iron sights come in all sizes and formats of adjustability. 
Fixed 
A fixed set of iron sights are about as basic as you can get. The term “fixed” means the sights are non-adjustable so the 
only way to accurately use them would be to aim off. Here is an example from a black powder handgun:

Foresight 
Rear sight 
 
 
 
 
As you can see, the sights are about as rudimentary as you can get. 
Adjustability 
There are various levels of adjustability with iron sight systems. 
Rear Sight 
This is a rear sight from the Marlin 1894 rifle: 
 
If you look closely at the image, you will see what looks like a miniature step ladder at the base of the sight. 
This ladder can be moved in and out, under the sight element. Pushing it forward, reducing the height of the rear sight, 
will lower the sight element thus moving your group down the target. Moving the ladder back will raise the group on 
your target. 
So, if you establish a centre hold (see Module 2 - Section 1) point of aim on your target and the group is below, raise 
the rear sight until the shots come up and meet your aiming mark.

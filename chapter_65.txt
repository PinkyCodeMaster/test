Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Position & Hold 
Remember: “The shooting position and hold must be firm enough to support the rifle” 
Day 1 is all about shooting from a standing position with a firearm unsupported by any other aid (bench etc.) so it’s 
very important that you are as comfortable as possible. Straining to get comfortable with a firearm will distract even 
the strongest person, and because of this, their thoughts will be drawn away from concentrating on the job at hand – 
shooting accurately, and they will be fretting about the pain developing in their shoulders/back/arm/anywhere else. 
The main thing to remember about using any firearm is: 
The firearm should always fit around you, not you around the firearm. 
 
 
Next, let’s look at the angle you are adopting in relation to the firearm and line of fire. Here you can see various angles 
as viewed from above: 
 
 
 
 
 Good, comfortable position 
 Head midway up butt stock 
 Shoulders relaxed 
 Great sight picture 
 
× Bad, uncomfortable position 
× Head far back on butt stock 
× Shoulders & driving hand tense 
× Terrible sight picture (especially with a 
scope) 
 
× Potential stress in lower back 
× Body support from behind greatly reduced 
× Butt stock re-located close to the bicep 
which when incorporated with a larger 
calibre with increased recoil will potentially 
hurt

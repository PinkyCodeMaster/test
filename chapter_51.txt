Section 3 – Firearm Mechanics (continued) 
So we now know what a bolt nose SHOULD look like (with the exception of the ejector), let’s have a look at one that 
clearly has an issue: 
 
 
Ignoring the fact that the lugs look like they’ve 
been nibbled on by something with very strong 
teeth, is there anything else that leaps out at you 
that’s clearly NOT meant to be present? 
 
 
 
 
 
If you said the firing pin, well done 
 
By simply checking the bolt face for a stuck firing pin and identifying it, you will almost certainly have saved yourself a 
potentially dangerous accident. 
If the bolt was rammed home on a live round with the firing pin protruding, there is a very real chance that the 
cartridge will be initiated BEFORE the bolt lugs have been rotated into their locked position as nobody on the planet is 
fast enough to lock the system faster than the cartridge takes to fire. The result is the bolt will be blown back into the 
shooter’s hand with the aforementioned 21 Tons of pressure and will in all likelihood, remove fingers etc. 
Remember Newton’s 3rd Law: 
For every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction

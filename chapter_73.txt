Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Natural Alignment 
Remember: “The rifle must point naturally at the target without any undue physical effort” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The subject above is perfectly comfortable and ready, only problem is the Natural Alignment to the target is off. Would 
the remedy be to bend the body across and move the rifle so it was back on aim? 
No, to do so would start imparting sideways stress to the shooter’s body and rifle. It will very quickly start to detract 
from concentrating on the objective of accurate shooting. 
The only option is to get up and relocate so the natural alignment is now correct. 
There are a number of ways you can test your natural alignment in any position you are shooting in.  
In the case of Day 1 standing unsupported, follow these easy steps to test yourself. 
 
With an empty firearm and with your eyes closed, adopt your most comfortable position and hold to where 
you think the target is 
 
Open your eyes and assess where you’re pointing 
 
If you’re dead in line with the target, congratulations! 
 
If not, don’t be tempted to start bending your torso/hips to accommodate getting on target 
 
Shuffle your entire body until you are aligned 
Now you have achieved the correct natural alignment to the target. 
Natural alignment and position and hold are interrelated and one cannot work properly without the other. 
Remember, the goal is good marksmanship skills.

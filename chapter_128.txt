Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA at ranges LESS THAN 100 yards (continued) 
What you don’t want to do is fire a shot, click your scope and fire again repeatedly: 
 
All this will accomplish is unzipping the target and wasting ammunition unnecessarily. 
 
 
 
What you want to do is: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fire a shot group 
 
measure from the bullet hole to where you 
want to be 
 
read the inch value and multiply by the distance 
factor (25 y = 4, 50 y = 2 etc.), explained on the 
previous page. 
 
apply the changes 
 
voila! 
 
 
Once you get the hang of it, it’s simple maths but you WILL save yourself a fortune in ammunition!

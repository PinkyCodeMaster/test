Section 3 â€“ Firearm Mechanics (continued) 
Rifling (continued) 
Fired bullets will all have markings cut into their driving areas (the contact point of the bullet to the barrel). Here is an 
example: 
 
 
 
This bullet has not been fired as there is clearly no 
witness mark around major diameter 
 
 
This one has been fired as you can clearly see the 
rifling grooves have been transferred to it. 
 
With advances in the development of rifled barrels, there are now a number of different styles of rifling: 
Cut Rifling: 
Cutting one groove at a time with a tool (single point cut rifling) or cutting all grooves in one pass with a special 
progressive broaching bit (broached cut rifling) 
Button rifling: 
A process where a machine presses all the grooves at once with a tool called a "button" that is pushed or pulled down 
the barrel. 
Hammer Forged: 
Forging the barrel over a mandrel containing a reverse image of the rifling with a giant hammer forging machine, often 
forging the chamber as well 
Polygonal: 
Formed similarly to hammer forged barrels, producing less pronounced "hills and valleys", so the barrel bore has a 
polygonal (usually hexagonal or octagonal) cross-sectional profile. Polygonal riflings with a larger number of edges 
have shallower corners, which provide a better gas seal in relatively large diameter bores.

Theory of the Group 
What does “Theory of the Group” mean? 
Put simply, a group is the collective pattern of shots recorded on a target. 
The theory of the group is defined thus: as the range increases, the size of the group increases in direct proportion. 
All modern firearms will shoot accurately but some are better than others. There are a myriad of different reasons why and they are beyond the scope of this Training 
Manual. Suffice it to say that as a general rule, the bigger the price ticket, the better the firearm will group but remember that’s a general rule. It is entirely possible that the 
price tag could be high but the quality could be low, thus affecting accuracy. 
The example below is a firearm that under optimal conditions can shoot a 1” group at 100 yards: 
 
As you can see, as you stretch the distance out past 100 yards, the group is going to get bigger. This is normal. If your firearm can shoot a 1” group at 1000 yards, you are 
either the luckiest person on the planet and WILL have queues of shooters from all over the planet, all desperate to give you their life savings for it, or you’re using a laser 
gun from a science fiction movie……. 
You will notice, we say “optimal conditions”, that means: 
 
that the firearm is locked into some form of device that prevents it from being moved 
 
there is NO wind blowing anywhere 
 
the firearm is mechanically sound (see Reference Material section on Cleaning & Maintenance)

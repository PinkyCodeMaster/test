Section 3 – Firearms (continued): 
Normal Safety Procedures or NSPs 
Before reading this section, refer to Safety Rule No 1. Which is: 
ALWAYS PROVE A FIREARM IS UNLOADED WHENEVER YOU PICK IT UP,  
OR HAND IT TO ANYONE, OR TAKE IT FROM ANYONE 
Normal Safety Procedures are a 3 fold checking process (after removing the magazine if fitted) that you want to repeat 
twice to absolutely, totally and utterly confirm to both yourself and others present that the firearm you are using OR 
are about to use is SAFE! 
Let’s break them down into the constituent parts using the Ruger 10/22 as an example. They apply equally if you’re 
starting shooting as well as finishing.

Repeat steps 3,4 & 5 
Well done, you have completed those NSP’s and vouched that the firearm is safe. 
These checks apply to all styles of firearms you handle throughout your career and when carried out correctly will 
send a very clear message to other range users that you know what you’re doing.

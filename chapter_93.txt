Section 1 –  
Sight Systems –  
Theory of the Group 
Outside contributing factors 
As discussed on the previous page, we touched on using something to lock the firearm straight towards the target. 
That obviously cancels out the primary contributing factor surrounding potential errors in a group, namely the 
shooter… 
Shooting accurately does require the firer to be “in the zone” so to speak. As an example, you could be out on an 
uncovered range, assessing your firearm and the weather decides to take a turn for the worse like it does here in the 
UK. 
The rain is coming down in sheets and you didn’t pack your wet weather gear. Water is running down your back, you’re 
lying in an ever deepening puddle of water and are thoroughly miserable. It’s a fair bet that your ability to ignore that 
lot and still attempt to shoot accurately has more than likely gone out the window. 
Firer Error 
Remember the Principles of Marksmanship you were taught in Module 1? Go back to that section and reacquaint 
yourself with them as 99% of firer errors can be attributed to an issue with them. 
Equipment Malfunctions 
Imagine jumping into your car and driving off only to find the back wheel overtaking you because you forgot to check 
it. The same applies to firearms and you should always perform a quick check and assessment of the following: 
 
 
 
Scope – Is it firmly attached to the firearm? 
• 
A loose scope will render your firearm hopelessly inaccurate and you will chase errors when zeroing 
• 
The scope can become detached and in all likelihood it will hit you in the face - painful 
• 
The scope could fall on a hard surface and potentially break – costly 
 
 
Bipod – If fitted, is it also firmly attached? 
• 
The firearm will fall off the bipod and you could damage/scratch your expensive purchase! 
• 
Loose bipods make it much harder to control as the firearm will wobble all over the place 
 
 
Stock – Check the screws (if fitted) & make sure it’s firmly attached 
• 
Loose screws will cause the metalwork of the firearm to move about during firing 
• 
The stock will become detached and WILL hit you in the face during recoil – very painful 
 
 
Sound Moderator/Muzzle Brake – Is it also firmly attached? 
• 
A loose sound moderator/brake will adversely affect accuracy 
• 
A sound moderator/brake that is very loose will almost certainly be damaged by bullet strike 
• 
A sound moderator/brake that becomes detached will fly down the range a good 70+ yards

Section 1 –  
Bisley General Info
Privileges and Responsibilities of NRA Membership 
Once you pass the course including the 2 mandatory Shooting Club visits and final unrestricted SCC issue, you will be 
granted full membership of the National Rifle Association with the following membership features: 
 
Book ranges up to 1200 yards unsupervised and hire markers at Bisley 
 
You can hire firearms and purchase ammunition from the Armoury within the provisions of the Firearms 
Act.  NB: Unless the ammunition sold is entered on your firearms certificate, it must be used on the day of 
purchase and must not be removed from Bisley 
 
All Full Members are entitled to register for the NRA Shooting Club (this will be automatically done for you 
upon completion of Day 4). Twice monthly shoots are planned covering all ranges and disciplines 
 
With this membership you will get comprehensive Insurance cover (see the NRA website for more up to date 
details)  
 
All Full Members are entitled to attend further training courses held at Bisley at discounted rates (this is also 
available to you upon completion of Day 4) 
 
You are entitled to compete in competitions held at Bisley, free of ‘meeting membership’ fees (this is also 
available to you upon completion of Day 4) 
 
The NRA Journal is published four times annually and is sent automatically to all members. It keeps you 
updated with news from Bisley and the shooting world 
 
Guest Days 
If you have an acquaintance that wishes to also get into shooting, you can invite them to special days registered as 
“Guest Days”. Your guest will have to submit what is known as a Declaration 21 which is a declaration from them that 
they are not a prohibited person in any way to be in contact with firearms. You can hire firearms from the NRA for this 
purpose if you do not possess firearms of your own.  
What you cannot do though is invite a friend down to Bisley to “have a go”. The last thing you want to do is get in 
trouble before you’ve even started your shooting career!

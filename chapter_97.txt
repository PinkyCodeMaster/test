Section 1 –  
Sight Systems – MPI 
Establish the MPI 
Was your assessment of the target about the same place? 
 
 
 
 
 
So, the first assessment places the MPI where the blue dot is placed. 
 
 
Our shooter now thinks the strike on the left in the centre of the target could have been a pulled shot so they are going 
to disregard that one for now and shoot a few more rounds to re-assess the MPI.

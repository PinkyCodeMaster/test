Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA at ranges Greater THAN 100 yards 
We are all affected by one common physical law. GRAVITY 
In order to successfully and repeatedly hit a target at a longer distance, the muzzle of the firearm HAS to be elevated a 
certain amount. By using an angular measurement system (MoA), we can very accurately adjust a sighting system but 
first we need to know how much. 
The elevation table below has been formulated based on a number of factors: 
 
Muzzle Velocity 
And 
 
Ballistic Coefficient (see Reference Section) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This table is relatively easy to use. 
For instance, you are zeroed at 100 yards and wish to shoot at 600 yards. Pick up your start distance on the left (100) 
and follow the row along till you intersect the “600” column. There is a number in it. This is the MoA value you need to 
apply to your sights in order to guarantee a successful first round hit somewhere on the target (remember safety!) 
What value did you find? - If it was “13” - well done, if not try again. 
When using tables such as these, it is very important to check and verify your readings as applying the wrong settings 
to sights at longer ranges could very easily send a bullet over the top of the butts and that means you have no idea 
where it went.  
REMEMBER – The bullets you fire are all your responsibility until they come to a stop,  
in the butts behind your target!

Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights–Iron 
Military Sight Systems 
These sight systems generally are graduated in distance rather than angular measurement (see the next section on 
MoA). 
 
Rear sight TOP VIEW 
The elevation adjustment on this style of sight involves 
pinching the knurled adjuster and moving it forward or 
backwards for large adjustments.  
Rear sight SIDE VIEW 
The knurled wheel on the right is for fine adjustment 
once the rear sight has been adjusted for rough 
elevation (see left)  
 
The “ears” either side of the sight are there for protection.  
 
 
 
 
Here you can see the adjustment has been applied to the sight to INCREASE elevation:

Accompanying Foresights 
 
 
You can see what appear to be “rabbit ears” either side of the foresight itself. 
These are simply the foresight blade protectors. If the rear sight is lost on a battle 
rifle, there is still a certain amount of effectiveness that can be attained by using 
the foresight only but it certainly won’t be accurate. 
If the foresight however is lost, there is little to no effective accuracy. 
NOTE: Don’t be tempted to use one of the ears as a surrogate foresight, they’ll 
throw your shots wildly left/right of the target AND because they are higher than 
the foresight, WILL throw your shots much lower than you wanted.

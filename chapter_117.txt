How to adjust sights – 
 Scope 
Reticles 
Simply put, it’s the “X” mark in the centre of the sight picture or the pattern of lines or markings built into the scope to 
provide the user with measurement references. 
Reticles or Rets as they are also known as are many and varied. There is literally a reticle style for any and all forms of 
scoped shooting from long range precision to hunting at night. 
When looking at reticles, it is important to understand that different manufacturers may call similar styles by different 
names which is a bit confusing so don’t take the description on the box as gospel, always look through the scope first. 
Here are some examples: 
 
Crosshair or Fine 
Crosshair. 
Minimum of additional 
information. Generally 
used by precision long 
range shooters 
 
Duplex. 
Faster target acquisition 
than the crosshair 
design but still no 
additional information 
for the shooter in terms 
of measurement 
reference 
German. 
This is a basic hunting 
reticle for fast target 
acquisition. 
 
Mildot. 
Probably the most 
widely used of rets even 
though the design was 
primarily for military 
ranging to target based 
on a given set of 
parameters. 
Measurement facility 
via the dots. 
Circle. 
Another fast target 
acquisition system. 
You may well find this 
optical system on 
shotguns too 
 
Range finding or BDC. 
BDC = Ballistic Drop 
Compensator. 
This design is more a 
“one size fits all” 
approach with the lower 
lines representing the 
predicted drop of 
certain bullets at 
distance

Final Test 
There’s always a test… 
The Probationary test is a 40 question multiple choice one. It is “closed book” meaning you should already be able to 
answer all the questions without help. The Instructors will talk you through this as you progress through the course but 
bear in mind there is a pass mark that has to be achieved. If for some reason you fail the test, the Lead Instructor or 
Chief Instructor will talk you through any remedial actions you are required to take in order to re-sit the test. 
If you have dyslexia (or similar), please don’t hide it but let an Instructor know and the team can take appropriate 
action to ensure you have a fighting chance with the test. 
 
 
A note on dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia 
If you suffer from any of the above, DON’T WORRY! There’s an exceptionally high chance that a good number of your 
fellow students have the condition too. 
AND… 
There are a number of Instructors you will meet on the course who have the same condition. Don’t hide it but speak to 
an Instructor at a suitable moment so that the team are aware.

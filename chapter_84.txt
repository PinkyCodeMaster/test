Module 2 – Section 1: Overview 
Module 2 of the Probationary Course is all about extending the range you’ve been shooting at to 100 yards. 
The day will start in the classroom where the basic concept of sighting systems will be explained. You will be shown 
how to boresight, assess your group and then adjust your sights accordingly before carrying out the practice on the 
range. 
The range session on this Module will involve first shooting the scoped 22 LR rifle you last used on Day 1 and there will 
be a number of exercises your Instructors will take you through. 
In the afternoon, you will then be introduced to the 7.62mm calibre scoped rifle. 
 
 
Firearms you will use 
You will be using two firearms on this Module and they will be introduced to you in the classroom prior to getting on 
the range.  
 
The first is a .22 LR scoped bolt action 
rifle.  
 
This Ruger bolt action you will 
remember from Module 1. 
 
 
The 3rd is a 7.62mm scoped bolt action 
rifle.

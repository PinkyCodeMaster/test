Wind Basics 
Wind – Basic Assessment (continued) 
As mentioned on the last page, wind will have an effect on bullet travel but that effect is by no means similar to all 
types and styles of bullet. The deciding factors are: 
 
Bullet Mass 
 
Bullet Speed 
 
The bullet’s Ballistic Coefficient 
For details on Ballistic Coefficients (BC’s), please refer to Module 3, Section 1 – The Wind and the glossary. 
 
 
Let’s look at the first two though. 
Bullet Mass 
The heavier an object travelling through the air is, the less likely it is going to be adversely affected by wind. In this 
area, we don’t mean volume though. Take for example a motorcycle being hit by a cross-wind and a tractor being hit 
by the same cross-wind. The motor bike will always be blown further off course than the tractor even though it 
occupies less volume. 
Bullet Speed 
The speed of the projectile also plays a major factor in any effects of a wind. The faster the bullet is going, the quicker it 
will get through the wind but that wind will still have an effect. 
If we look at the two calibres you are shooting as part of this module, you will almost certainly experience wind 
deflection at 100 yards with the 22 LR rifle but unless you are in a hurricane, there will be no discernible effect on the 
7.62/308 Cal bullet at all. 
Let’s look at the picture on the previous page. You are in the centre of the circle (clock face) firing towards 12 O'clock. 
Introduce a wind from the right (the purple line) and your bullet is going to be blown off course by a certain amount in 
a curve. 
In order to compensate for the wind, you need to aim INTO the wind and your bullet will still be curved in its flight but 
it will hit what you were shooting at. 
 
 
This part of the manual is purely an introduction to wind so you are aware of the overall effects. We will cover how to 
deal with the effects of wind in much greater detail in Module 3.

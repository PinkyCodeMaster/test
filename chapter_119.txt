Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights – 
Scope 
Reticles (continued) 
The previous examples are one side of the scale but imagine a reticle so jammed with information that you literally 
cannot get a good sight picture because of the amount of extraneous data being presented to you: 
 
You can clearly see that there is too much information being displayed above that is going to hinder a decent sight 
picture. Sometimes, less is more. 
 
 
Illuminated Reticles 
This system basically has a dial mechanism that is adjusted for brightness by the user. There is a minute diode 
internally that is projected onto the reticle, illuminating it. An example can be seen on the previous page. Most 
illuminated systems use the colour red but there are a few that also use green in addition. As with all things electronic, 
what needs switching on also needs to be switched off! One of the biggest problems with these systems is forgetting 
to turn them off and the next time they are used, there is an almost certainty that you don’t have a spare battery. 
There are however certain systems that operate via “shake awake” parameters. This system will shut itself off if it 
detects no movement after a certain amount of time.

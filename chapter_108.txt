1st & 2nd Focal Plane 
Scopes come in 2 formats, 1st & 2nd focal plane. 
A 1st focal plane scope reticle grows or diminishes in size when the magnification setting is adjusted whereas a 2nd focal 
plane scope reticle stays the same size, irrespective of the magnification setting. 
 
 
1st Focal Plane 
Benefits 
Pitfalls 
Markings represent the same 
measurement throughout the 
magnification range 
Higher Price bracket 
Saves on additional maths when working 
out ranging to target 
Much smaller reticle at low mag 
Better suited to long range shooting with 
a fine reticle 
Target can be obscured at high mag 
 
 
 
2nd Focal Plane 
Benefits 
Pitfalls 
Lower Price bracket 
Beware very cheap scopes. Remember 
the old adage – “Buy cheap, buy twice” 
Reticle the same size throughout the 
magnification range 
Markings DO NOT represent the same 
measurement throughout the 
magnification range 
Target will not be obscured at high mag 
Additional maths IS REQUIRED when 
working out ranging to target 
Better suited for shorter ranges and 
hunting 
You need to check & confirm the 
magnification setting for true MoA or 
MilRad settings 
 
Why is a 1st focal plane scope more expensive than a 2nd focal plane? 
Basically, it’s the position of the physical reticle within the scope itself. 1st focal plane rets are positioned forward of the 
saddle (main control surface) whereas a 2nd focal plane scope is positioned to the rear, near the ocular. Making it closer 
to the shooters eye.

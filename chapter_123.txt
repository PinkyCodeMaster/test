Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA? 
MoA simply stands for Minute of Angle. 
All sighting systems use some form of angular measurement in order to be adjusted to accurately place bullets on 
target at different distances. 
There are two types of angular measurement, Minutes of Angle and Mils. Note: we cover Mils later in the manual in 
the Reference Section. At Bisley, most longer ranges (greater than 50 m/yds.) are measured in YARDS.  
By some fluke of nature, the Minute of Angle angular measurement system maps almost perfectly with yards.  
First, let’s look at exactly what a MoA is. 
Take a circle and take out 1 degree which is 1/360th of that circle:  
 
The angle pictured is clearly NOT 1 degree! 
But is simply to give you an idea 
 
 
 
Now, take that 1 degree and divide it by 60 = 1/60th of a degree which is 1 Minute of Angle. 
1 Minute of Angle is a very small angle we think you’ll agree. 
So, take that angle and stretch the legs out to 100 yards. The distance between the legs of the angle are about 1”. In 
fact, they are exactly 1.047” but let’s face it, 47 thousands of an inch equates to the thickness of about 8-10 sheets of 
paper which is neither here nor there in shooting terms. 
 
 
 
 
 
This is the basis for applying elevation to sights in order to hit targets at longer distances as bullets are all affected by 
one thing that is constant on this planet. Gravity. 
 
When you fire a bullet at a target, its highest point will always be the line of the bore and as it exits the bore, it will 
start dropping back down to earth.

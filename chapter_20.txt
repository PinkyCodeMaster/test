Section 1 –  
Bisley General Info 
Attendance Recording 
All Home Office Approved Clubs are required by law to record members shooting attendance –  
The Firearms Amendment Act of 1988 – Section 15. 
This information may be requested at any time by the relevant Firearms Licensing Authority to verify that a person is 
actually using firearms on a regular basis. 
Failure by a club to properly maintain a log of its members shooting visits may affect its approval status 
NRA JustGo System 
If you have joined the NRA, you will have received details of your login for the JustGo system. If not, your club will have 
some form of recording facility so speak to your Instructor and find out your club process. 
NRA Members 
The JustGo system used by the NRA to record and maintain all the personal data for each member. It is an online 
resource which can be accessed by you to amend your personal details and record details of firearms owned or used 
by you. It also allows you to maintain a record of all your attendances at Bisley. 
When training as a new shooter, the chances are pretty high that you won’t in fact have a Firearm Certificate (FAC) so 
you can now log on to your JustGo account and record these times when you have used firearms at Bisley. The system 
is setup in such a way that firearms ownership is not a prerequisite of recording your shooting. 
For example, let’s say you are attending your first day of training. As you will have already found out, you will be using 
3 types of firearm – a 22 Ruger semi auto, a Marlin 357 Mag and a Ruger bolt action. That’s 3 entries right there. 
First, you need to log on via the information sent to you by the NRA Membership Department.

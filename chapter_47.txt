Section 3 – Firearm Mechanics (continued) 
Whenever you handle a firearm for the first time, it is highly recommended that you conduct a visual inspection of the 
working parts and any accessories attached to make sure it’s all secure. 
Your checklist should start at the back and work your way forward. Obviously don’t bother checking say a bipod if 
none is fitted. 
1. Buttstock – Pad secure? 
2. Pistol grip – cracks or splits? 
3. Stock Screws – Secure & tight? 
4. Bolt – 
a. Face 
i. Firing pin NOT sticking out? 
ii. Extractor OK? 
iii. Ejector present? 
iv. Lugs not sheared off? 
b. Handle not broken? 
5. For SCOPE Sights 
a. Rail secure? 
b. Mounts & rings secure? 
c. Scope attached & bedded securely? 
d. Check Windage & Elevation settings (see Module 2) 
6. For IRON Sights 
a. Rear Sight system secure? 
b. Check Aperture OK? 
c. Check Windage & Elevation settings (see Module 3) 
d. Check the Front Sight is securely attached to the barrel 
7. Barrel Clear of any obstruction (remove the bolt first)? 
8. Stock Forend 
a. Bipod OK (if fitted)? 
b. Sling Stud loose? 
c. Other furniture attached properly? 
9. Muzzle – Moderator/Brake secure & tight? 
Although you may think this list rather long and in depth, the whole assessment will only take a minute.

Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Sight Picture 
Remember: “Sight alignment and sight picture must be correct” 
On day 1 you will be using open sighted firearms and although rudimentary, they are still accurate enough to shoot a 
small group. The sight picture for iron or open sights consists of lining up the rear sight with the foresight, on the 
target.

Put it all together and this is what you should see: 
(This sight picture is very similar to the sight picture 
of the Marlin lever action you will also use) 
 
 
 
 
 
This is what the sight picture through the Marlin lever 
action looks like. As you can see, very similar to the 
Ruger in that you place the foresight bead in the bottom 
part of the rear sight. Remember consistency so always 
use the same sight picture. 
 
 
Always remember, ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE FORESIGHT!

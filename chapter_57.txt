Section 3 – Ammunition (continued) 
A round of ammunition typically is made of 4 components: 
① The Bullet 
This is the projectile that comes out the barrel and impacts the target. Usually constructed of 
lead or a combination of lead, copper and polymers but construction is dictated by the 
intended use and velocity. 
② The Case 
This is the bit that holds all the components together and upon firing is the only bit left behind. 
③ The Powder 
Modern shooters powder (also known as smokeless powder) is a combination of nitrocellulose, 
nitro-glycerine and various other trace chemicals plus a coating of inhibitor to control and 
regulate the burn rate.  
④ The Primer 
This is the only explosive component of the package and contains a shock sensitive compound 
that when struck, will explode. Thus igniting the powder. 
 
 
Here is a pulled round with all four components. You will notice that the cartridge case actually has a fired or spent 
primer already seated within. This is purely for display purposes. 
Although technically outside the scope of this Manual, many students do ask about the possibility of making 
ammunition from the fired cases and the answer is yes. A great many shooters reload their own ammunition. It is both 
rewarding, produces more accurate ammo than can be commercially made and is generally cheaper. The NRA runs a 
Basic Handloading Course which will help you through the process later in your shooting career.

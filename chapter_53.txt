Section 3 – Ammunition 
Ammunition is a general term for anything that can be fired, scattered, dropped or detonated from any form of 
weapon system. 
You will hear terms like round and cartridge too. For civilian shooting in the UK, we obviously do not deal with bombs, 
grenades or missiles so the term applies to what is called “small arms ammunition”.  
General 
Here is a line-up of some of the calibres you will encounter throughout the course: 
 
From left to right they are: 5.56mm – .308 Winchester – .38 Special – .22 LR 
As you can see, some are straight walled and some are bottlenecked cartridges. Some have rims and some are rimless. 
 
Here is a statistic that you should always remember when it comes to safely handling firearms. How far the bullet will 
travel if you accidentally fire it when the firearm is pointing approximately 30 degrees off the horizontal: 
Calibre 
Distance IN MILES! 
.22 LR 
Approx 1 MILE 
.38 /.357 mag 
Approx 1 MILE 
5.56 
Approx 2 ½  MILES 
.308/7.62 
Approx 2 ½  MILES 
 
If you fire a .22 on the Winans range over the backstop at an angle off the target line, it WILL reach houses outside the 
danger area in Bisley town. Similarly, the danger area beyond the butts on Short Siberia Range is approximately 2 miles 
then it’s Camberley…

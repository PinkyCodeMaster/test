Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Shot release & follow through (continued) 
So, you’ve adopted the perfect position and hold, your natural alignment to the target is the stuff of legends and you 
have the perfect sight picture via the perfect breath hold. You fire the shot and immediately jump off the firearm to see 
your prowess through a spotting scope only to discover you missed… so what happened? 
You moved off the rifle too soon and interrupted the shot. 
Remember those 2 seconds? - Always pause after the shot release to assess the rifle’s final position after it comes to 
rest. 
What else can follow through analysis tell you about your shooting? 
Ask your Instructor to watch and monitor your shot process throughout the follow through segment. 
 
They will watch for any small movements of your body during or directly after the shot is fired to ascertain 
whether your Position & Hold/Natural Alignment combination is not constructed properly. Typically seen by 
strong arming the firearm back into place rather than letting a correct Position & Hold do the job
 
They will also look out for any movement in the rifle due to your relaxation after the shot is released. This 
movement in the firearm usually indicates you are using muscles to strong arm the firearm into place, 
increasing stresses and strain on your body. This is a clear indicator of incorrect Position & Hold
 
They will also look for a correct eye position

Section 1 –  
Sight Systems – MPI 
Establish the MPI (continued) 
 
Our shooter fires another three shots and you can see below the MPI has clearly shifted from its original position. 
Our shooter has re-assessed the target and thinks they may have pulled the one on the left which was the first shot 
they fired in the initial string.. 
As you can now see, the MPI has subtly moved below and right of the original assessment. 
 
 
 
 
 
You can see now that it is very important to fire AT LEAST 3 shots to carry out an assessment of your group. Our 
shooters first shot was in the centre, so if they had used that single shot as a basis for changing the sights, the 
subsequent grouping would have been low and right. 
When you carry out this process yourself, you need to make a mental note of any pulled or otherwise bad shots. These 
can then be ignored when making an assessment of your group before adjusting your sights. 
Remember the rule when doing this exercise - MAINTAIN THE SAME POINT OF AIM! 
 
Next, we’ll look at Section 2 which is how to adjust those sights

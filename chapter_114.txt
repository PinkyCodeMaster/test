Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights – 
Scope 
Putting it all together 
So, we now know that there are two focus steps within the scope in the following order: 
 
Ocular Focus – 1st, bring the reticle into sharp focus, irrespective of what you are looking at through the scope 
 
Parallax/main focus to target – 
o Dial up magnification to a high setting 
o Aim at the target 
o Adjust the focus ring until the target snaps into sharp focus 
o Dial down your magnification and assess the parallax by wiggling your head  
o Congratulations, that’s all there is to adjusting out parallax. 
 
Now you will need to apply elevation and windage and you do that by turning the turrets described in C & D. In order 
to accurately apply elevation, you first need to know how much to add – seems reasonable? 
Knowing how much elevation to add will be covered in the next part of this section – MoA but for this example, let’s 
assume you need to add 36 ½ MoA to your scope in order to successfully hit a target 1000 yards away from your zero 
position of 100 yards. 
 
 
This is your scope elevation turret. 
Please refer to the previous section under “C” & “D” so you are re- 
familiarised with what each piece of information means. 
Your scope is zeroed for 100 yards and you have previously set 
the Zero Stop feature at “0” so you can easily reset your scope 
back to 0 so you always know your initial settings. Make sense so 
far? 
 
You intend shooting at 1000 yards and the elevation for 
that distance with your rifle is 36 ½ MoA as mentioned 
previously. 
You have two options, either: 
 
Aim off by shooting above the target, guessing 
 
= NOT GOOD! 
 
Adjust the elevation by rotating the turret by 
the correct amount 
As you can see from the picture on the right, the turret has 
been turned up by 36 ½ MoA. 
What? – You say… read on!

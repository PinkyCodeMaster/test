Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Position & Hold (continued) 
In addition to the above, let’s look at a couple of examples of positions adopted that can cause undue stress on your 
body. The ideal, personal position you need to adopt when shooting unsupported should be as comfortable as possible 
with an absolute minimum of stress to your body. This ensures you are 100% concentrating on shooting accurately and 
not thinking about that growing pain in your lower back as it will detract from what you want to accomplish. Accurate 
shooting! 
 
 
“The Banana Position” 
This is a fairly common position adopted by new shooters. We all have a tendency to adopt this position in an 
attempt to offset your balance against the rifle. 
 
As you can see from the side view, the back is bent backwards and the head is positioned at the back of 
the butt stock. 
 
From the front view, the subject’s head is also bent over the stock in an attempt to compensate for 
the rearward head position. 
 
What we have is stress up the back from the hips all the way to the base of the head through the neck. 
 
Breathing is partially restricted due to the neck bend 
 
There is also a good chance of the onset of symptoms of vertigo due to the angled head position

Scope 
Reticles (continued) 
The examples overleaf are the tip of the iceberg when it comes to design of different rets. 
 
Take a design like the Fine Crosshair then place a dot in the centre. This ret is known as a “Target Dot”. 
It’s great for offhand style, fast target acquisition shooting but due to the size of the dot, a considerable part of the 
centre of the target will be covered. That makes accurate shooting more about guesswork than pinpoint accuracy. 
The choice of reticle you go for will depend entirely on what you intend to use it for. A Fine Crosshair ret is ideal for 
precision shooting at a high contrast target like a standard Bisley style bullseye but it will be lost on a complex 
background target like a DP2: 
 
 
As you can see on the left, 
it’s pretty hard to 
distinguish the crosshair 
against this style of target. 
This is compounded when 
you have to lift the scope to 
your eye in a speed shoot 
competition. You will be 
severely limiting your 
competitiveness as a result. 
By contrast, the illuminated 
Mildot reticle on the right is 
much more visible.

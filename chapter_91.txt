Section 1 –  
Sight Systems - Boresighting 
I can’t see down the barrel 
There are times when it’s an almost impossible task to effectively boresight. A classic example is the Ruger 10/22® that 
is used on NRA Training courses. Many private owners have gone to great lengths to try and solve this problem and 
one of the most common is drilling a hole in the back of the receiver to make a “peep hole”. This hole can also be used 
for cleaning purposes with a rod but the act of drilling a hole in the receiver will: 
 
Invalidate your warranty 
 
Put the firearm “out of proof” as you have modified a pressure bearing part of the firearm which means you 
cannot sell it on until you submit your firearm for re-proof. That’s costly. 
Your only alternative is to zero your firearm at a close range. Usually 25 yards as the bullets will be captured by the 
butt stop and you can see the strike and change accordingly. This will work even if your sights are seriously off. 
Once you have close range zeroed your firearm, you can progressively increase the distance and make changes, but 
this does all depend on whether you have access to other ranges to accomplish this. Fortunately, there are a number 
of ballistic apps available which will give you extremely accurate elevation data, but it’s all dependant on what you 
enter first. 
 
 
To summarise… 
 
 
The only way to effectively set your sights on such a firearm is to start at a close range like 25 yards and either 
 
establish a zero @ 25 yards then increase distance 
or 
 
establish a zero then use additional data (ballistic coefficient & muzzle velocity) to apply in a ballistic app which 
is covered in the Reference Material section “Introduction to Ballistics Applications” at back of this manual

Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Position & Hold (continued) 
Eye dominance is another factor when shooting. There is no hard and fast rule though as to which of your eyes is 
dominant. 
This example is that of a right handed shooter with extreme left eye dominance: 
 
 
 
Eye Dominance 
As you can see, in order for the subject to get a decent sight picture, his head is literally wrapped over the butt stock. In 
terms of body stress, it’s very similar to the first example. The subject is attempting to adopt a neutral Position & Hold 
on the buttstock but due to the eye dominance factor, the head is being forced backwards from the neck. 
What does all this add up to? 
 
Increases stresses similar to the previous example 
 Poor accuracy and a lack of positional consistency will ultimately be the result

Section 3 – Firearm Mechanics (continued) 
Firearms and Ammunition Interactivity (continued_ 
Let’s take a closer look at the interaction mentioned previously 
 
This rear support of the base of the cartridge will 
prevent any movement when the system is fired. There 
is in fact a tiny amount of room between the bolt face 
and the cartridge which is called headspace. It is 
necessary for the cartridge to flex at the moment of 
firing in order to form a gas seal at the front. 
You will also notice a set of lugs on the bolt face, these 
are designed to interconnect with the inside of the 
receiver (action) which has a machined mirror of the 
lugs to engage with. 
This is how the action is locked prior to firing, ensuring 
you don’t get a bolt in the face! 
 
 
It’s important to know the locking mechanism is robust enough to ensure the bolt continues to be locked during firing 
because in a full bore rifle like a .308, there is approximately 21 tons per square inch of pressure only a few inches 
away from your head. 
21 Tons per sq. inch = 47,040 PSI = 3243 BAR = Lots! 
That’s a lot of pressure. 
You will find variations on a theme with firearms and high pressure cartridges. They all employ the same style of lug 
system though with 2 or more. 
 
 
By contrast, the average handgun chamber pressure is approximately 35,000 PSI and shotgun ammunition is 
considerably lower at an average of around 14,000 PSI. 
 
14,000 PSI is still a fairly impressive 6 ¼ Tons per Sq. Inch though and will prove painful if your hand should be in the 
way. This double barrelled shotgun burst and was subsequently destroyed when a smaller diameter cartridge had 
found its way accidentally into the chamber, in front of a 12 bore cartridge which was subsequently loaded and fired.

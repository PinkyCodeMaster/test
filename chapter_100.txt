Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights–Iron 
Focus 
Always remember the golden rule with iron sight systems – ALWAYS FOCUS ON THE FORESIGHT! 
 
 
During the course, you will be using three distinctly different styles of iron sight from the basic “Buckhorn” style to the 
intricate Vernier setup. 
Let’s start with the basic elements of using iron sights. 
Remember, the Principles of Marksmanship are key to accurate shooting so if those elements are not in place first, 
poor shooting will almost always be the result. Refer to the section on Principles of Marksmanship if required. 
 
Different Sight Pictures 
The definition of Sight Picture is: 
With the exception of the Vernier sight system, you can adopt whatever hold & sight picture you like on the target but 
always remember that consistency is the name of the game here and altering your aim part way through a shoot will 
produce a different group. 
Two of the most common iron sight pictures adopted are the Six O’clock and Centre Hold. 
Six O’clock Hold 
Centre Hold or point of aim 
 
Whichever hold you decide to take on a target, always remember that magic word in accurate shooting – consistency. 
Keep using the same hold throughout the string you’re firing or you will end up with a shotgun pattern. 
Both holds have their own Pro’s and Con’s:

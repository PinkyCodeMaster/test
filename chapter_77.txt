Section 4 – The Principles of Marksmanship 
Sight Picture (continued) 
Here are three different focus points, the 1st picture (left) shows focus on the target, the 2nd focused on the rear sight 
and the 3rd is focused on the foresight. 
 
 
Target 
Rear Sight 
Foresight 
Incorrect : you cannot accurately 
place the foresight/rear sight 
combination accurately on the 
target because you can’t see them 
clearly 
Incorrect : Your depth of perception 
is too short focusing on the rear 
sight so it’s very easy to stray away 
from the target 
Correct : The foresight guides good 
accuracy, your focus is beyond the 
rear sight, helping the target to be 
clearer, and the sight picture, 
although slightly out of focus is 
much clearer when it comes to 
reading all three objects. 
Remember: Your eyes can only focus on one object at a time!

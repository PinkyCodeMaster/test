Section 3 – Firearm Mechanics (continued) 
Firearms and Ammunition Interactivity 
Let’s take a bolt action rifle as an example here 
 
 
Looking from left to right, we see the bolt is in a forward position and has been locked down. Superimposed is a 
sectioned barrel with a round of ammunition. You can see that the base of the round is not in fact supported by the 
chamber of the barrel at all. 
 
 
It is in fact supported by the bolt nose so we have a locking system comprising the barrel with its chamber supplying 
most of the support for the cartridge with the bolt taking up the job of supporting the rear of the cartridge.

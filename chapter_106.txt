Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights– 
Iron Conclusion 
In Summary 
With iron sights, the rule is: 
To raise the point of impact or increase the elevation – RAISE THE REAR SIGHT  
To accomplish the same if the foresight is adjustable – LOWER THE FORESIGHT 
A rear sight without any elevation applied 
The rear sight has had elevation applied and you can 
see that the barrel is substantially elevated, meaning 
the shot will go higher. This is the basis for accurate 
shooting at longer distances

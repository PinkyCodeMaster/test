Vernier Sights 
Target Rifles are equipped with aperture sights. They are designed for maximum precision and are highly accurate even 
at 1000 yards. The rear aperture consists of a disk up to 1 inch in diameter with a small adjustable hole in the middle. It 
is through this hole which the Foresight ring and aiming mark are aligned. 
This sight system is a very sophisticated design. They are graduated in Minutes of Angle measurement (see the next 
section on MoA). 
They are adjustable for both elevation and windage. For a detailed explanation of this sight system, refer to the section 
in Module 3.

To the right of the scale, 
you will see the numbers 
rising from “2” to “10”. 
These are approximate 
ranges engraved on the 
scale for the shooter’s use 
but if the zero screws are 
“slipped”, the range scale 
will no longer be useable

Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA (continued) 
As you can see, the further the range, the further apart the legs of the angle become but the size of the angle stays the 
same, in other words, if you come up 5 MoA at 100 yards – it’s 5”. That same 5 MoA at 500 yards increases to 25”. 
One of the biggest errors by shooters is to get fixated on the relationship of the minute to the inch at 100 yards which 
is 1 to 1. This error can either cost you a miss at closer ranges or potentially be hazardous at longer ranges. 
An example: 
You are shooting at a distance of 500 yards. Your rifle is zeroed for 100 yards and you know how much elevation to 
apply in order to successfully hit the target at 500. You go ahead and apply that elevation. 
You fire a shot and the marker tells you that you are 3 feet below the target.  
OK, you say. I’m still on the target board so I’ll go ahead and add some elevation. But how much? 
 
3 feet = 36 inches – so far so good 
How many minutes is 36” at 500 yards? 
 
36 MoA… surely? – Oops… you’ve just fallen into the 1 to 1 @ 100 fixation hole. 
At 100 yards, 1 MoA is indeed 1 inch BUT… that same 1 MoA at 500 yards is 5” 
Consult the chart on the previous page. 
If you applied 36 MoA to your sights, you’d have effectively elevated them by 36 x 5 or 180 inches which is 15 feet.  
There is a very REAL danger you are accidentally throwing bullets clean over the backstop and that is extremely 
dangerous! 
 
An easy method is to look at the following formula with this data: 
Distance 
500 yards 
Amount of adjustment in inches 
36 inches 
MoA Value 
1 MoA = 5” @ 500 yards 
 
 
= 
 
= 7.2 or 7 ¼ MoA 
 
 
As you can see, a simple equation.  
The top of the formula is the distance in inches your shot is off. 
The bottom of the formula is the minute value for that distance, also in inches.

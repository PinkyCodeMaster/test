Section 1 –  
Bisley General Info 
NRA JustGo System (continued) 
When you click on this menu option, you will see the 
data entry box pictured right. 
 
 
 
 
The “Firearms Owned” data box is a pull down which 
contains all the firearms you previously entered. In 
our example, we are going to select “Ruger” 
 
 
Once selected, the “Make”, “Calibre” & “Serial 
Number” boxes are automatically filled for you. 
 
The “Date of Usage” box will revert to today’s date 
but you can edit if you are adding shots 
retrospectively. 
 
“Where Shot” will default to “Bisley” so leave that as 
is. 
 
The “Activity” box is a drop down and you need to 
select “Training” from the list 
 
Once complete, click “Save” and your record will be 
recorded. If the date you entered is in the future, an 
error message will be displayed 
As you can see, the process is relatively painless. 
Once you gain an FAC, you should add newly purchased firearms to the system as soon as possible so you can record 
your continued shooting. 
If you should encounter any issues regarding the JustGo system, please do not hesitate in contacting the Membership 
Department on 01483 797777. 
 
 
What does all this logging achieve? 
The Firearms Enquiry Team in your county will always want to see clear evidence of your regular shooting. Without 
this evidence you run the risk of losing that firearm. It is also known as “use it or lose it”. This clear evidence, coupled 
with entries of ammunition purchases will satisfy the authorities that you are a legitimate shooter. Logging your 
attendances during training is perfectly valid and as mentioned previously, a legal requirement which will supplement 
your initial grant of a licence too.

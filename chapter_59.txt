Section 3 – Ammunition (continued) 
To fire a round of ammunition, the primer has to be struck by the firing pin. There are two forms of case incorporating 
a primer, they are either Rimfire (RF) or Centrefire (CF).  
A CF cartridge is initiated 
by a separate primer cap 
which is press fitted into 
the base of the centre of 
the case. 
 
An RF cartridge is 
initiated by being struck 
anywhere on the rim of 
the case. 
 
You can see that the instant benefit of CF over RF is the primer is a separate entity on the CF case and can be pushed 
out and the case recycled, thus allowing the user to build a fresh round of ammunition whereas the RF case is 
essentially 1 shot and disposed of. It is extremely difficult to accidentally have a CF round of ammunition go off outside 
a firearm as a result of dropping, but on the other hand it is extremely easy (and unlucky) to accidentally initiate a RF 
round because the rim is effectively exposed. 
Rimfire - 22 Long Rifle (LR) 
This will be the first calibre you will be introduced to on Day 1. The .22 LR was originally introduced in 1887 by the J. 
Stevens Arms & Tool Company who developed it from a much older cartridge, the .22 BB Cap which dates back to 
1845. 
This is a .22 LR cartridge 
 
The .22 LR case is the same diameter as the bullet (0.224”) and 
the bullet uses what is called a “heel” which is slightly narrower 
than cartridge diameter. It is pressed into the case and a crimp 
applied. 
 
As you can see, this is the heel part of the bullet. 
 
 
This is a cross section of how the RF round looks put together. 
You can see that the majority of the bullet is exposed whereas 
with a CF round (at the end of Section 3 - Ammunition) it is 
mostly enclosed and protected by the case. You can see from 
this image that the primer is spun into the case rim.

Scope 
Eye Relief 
All scopes need a certain amount of distance between the shooter’s eye and the eyepiece. If you press your eye up 
against the ocular and fire, you WILL get what is commonly known as a “scope kiss”. That is when the ocular hits you 
just above your eye, usually breaking the skin and causing you some pain and discomfort. 
Most scopes will have a measured distance of between 2 ¾ & 3 ½ inches to gain the correct eye relief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You can always tell if your eye relief is not 
correct by the view you can see through 
the ocular. 
If you are too close or too far away, the 
outside of the sight picture will be very 
blurred: 
The easiest method of measuring the 
correct eye relief is to put your hand 
between your eye and the ocular. The 
average hand is approximately 3 inches 
across and will be the perfect 
measurement tool. 
 
 
 
How do I set the Eye Relief on my firearm? 
When setting up the scope (more details on this topic in the Reference Section), you have to decide what position you 
are going to adopt for the vast majority of your shooting as that will be the ultimate determinant of the relative 
position you place your scope on the rail. In general terms, if you intend using the scope mainly standing like in a 
hunting situation, your scope will be located further forward than if you mainly shot from the prone position.

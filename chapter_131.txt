Wind Basics 
Wind – Basic Assessment 
As you would expect, the wind does play a significant role in the ability of a shooter to successfully and accurately hit a 
target consistently at distance. 
It is also something that you cannot get away from when shooting on any outdoor range. 
What effect does wind have? 
It will push any projectile in its direction of travel. Depending on the mass and speed of the projectile, it will be affected 
to a greater or lesser degree. Distance also plays a part. A heavy bullet fired from a 7.62/308 rifle at 100 yards is not 
going to be adversely affected by a side wind, however a light bullet from say a 22LR will be pushed off course. 
How to deal with wind 
 
A - Establish where it’s coming from 
 
B - Adjust the sights INTO the wind by the appropriate amount 
 
C - Fire, assess and adjust further if necessary 
 
 
At this stage of the course, we are establishing the fact of wind. For a more in depth look at accurate wind assessment,

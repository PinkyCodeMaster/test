Section 2 –  
How to adjust sights–Iron 
Adjustability (continued) 
Adjustment for windage on a sight like this has a little less “finesse” and involves a hammer and punch to physically 
move the entire rear sight left and right by tapping on the “V” notch forward of the rear sight assembly. There is no 
degree of accuracy with this form of adjustment at all but a word of caution, if you carry out this operation, go at it 
gently as it is very easy to give the sight a whack and send it flying off the rifle to land in a secret hiding place that you’ll 
never find… 
Here is a picture of the standard rear sight from a Ruger 10/22 rifle: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As you can see, the difference between this style of sight 
and the Marlin is a certain amount of accuracy in 
elevation adjustment via a small screw. You simply 
loosen the screw a little and lift or push down on the 
sight element. 
 
 
 
 
Windage adjustability is exactly the same as the Marlin 
with a hammer and punch. You can clearly see the “V” 
notch in this photo. 
 
 
Accompanying Foresights 
 
 
 
 
 
As you would expect on general purpose firearms like this, the foresight will be 
fixed only. This example is from the Ruger and is known as a “Bead” foresight. 
 
You can probably see that there is a similar method of attachment of this foresight 
to the body of the barrel but it is not designed for adjustability like the rear sight.

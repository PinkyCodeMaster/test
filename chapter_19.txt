Section 1 –  
Bisley General Info 
Rules & Regulations 
As you would imagine, shooting in the UK is very heavily regulated and as a result, we have to ensure that we are all 
abiding by those rules and regulations that govern the continued safety of our sport. 
The Rules & Regulations are published by the National Shooting Centre which is responsible for the operation of all 
Bisley Ranges and governs the safe conduct of all shooting on those Ranges. 
You will receive a pamphlet containing the latest Bisley Rules and Regulations upon your arrival on Day 1. They are also 
available from the following sources: 
 
Bisley Bible 
This will have been handed to you as part of your Day 1 package. It contains all the rules and regulations relevant to 
Bisley at the front of the book. The main body is dedicated to the individual rules governing all the competitions shot 
at Bisley. 
NRA/NSC Website 
Those same rules and regulations are also available for download on the NRA’s website. They are in PDF format and 
are updated in some cases, several times a year. The address is:  
https://nationalshootingcentre.co.uk/range-regulations/ 
Range Office 
They are also printed and pinned to the wall in the Bisley Range Office for you to look at. 
 
It’s a very good idea to acquaint yourself with the rules and regulations. There is nothing worse than starting your 
shooting career on a bad note. Many of them will probably not make much sense to begin with but as you progress 
through the course, they will become clear to you or will be explained. 
 
Remember though, these rules & regulations also apply to everybody else (with the exception of HM Armed Forces & 
Government Agencies who have their own NSC approved procedures) on the ranges so if you see something being 
done that you feel uneasy about, report it to Range Control. It might be nothing, and there again…

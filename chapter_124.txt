Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA (continued) 
To accurately hit a target at a distance, you have to raise the muzzle in order to change the path of the bullet to 
overcome gravity: 
 
 
 
 
You can see that now you have two options to hit a target at distance: 
 
Either: Guess and spray bullets all over the place, thus becoming a danger to everybody in the locality and in 
all likelihood being thrown off the range 
Or:  
 
Apply an amount of elevation to your sight system to accurately hit the target 
There are basically three different types of sighting systems 
 
Iron (open sights) 
 
Scope 
 
Red Dot 
All systems adhere to the same principles when it comes to adjustment but there are some subtle differences. 
For a full description on sighting systems, please refer to the relevant section in this manual. 
 
Now that we’re happy 1 MoA is roughly an inch at 100 yards, let’s look at extending the legs out further. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 MoA =      1”                     2”                        3”                        4”                        5”

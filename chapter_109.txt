Understanding the Scopes Control Surface 
– Naming the parts 
Let’s look at the basic controls of a scope and then an in depth description of what each item does. Below is the Vortex 
Viper PST 5-25x50 1st focal plane scope 
 
In Summary… 
Ocular Lens & Focus ring: This is the lens you look through. When you look through a scope, the reticle should be in 
sharp focus. At this stage, it doesn’t really matter what you’re looking at. If the reticle is not crisp, it will compound 
parallax issues. 
Mag Adjustment Ring: This ring adjusts the magnification of a scope. Higher magnification is akin to zooming in on a 
target. 1x power is the same zoom setting as the human eye. 
Elevation Turret: This dial is used to increase or decrease elevation. They can be either exposed in the case of a target 
system or capped in the case of a hunting system. Depending on the system and the manufacturer, they may also have 
stadia printed in order to easily reference how much elevation has been applied. 
Windage Turret: This dial is used to apply left or right changes to the reticle in the same way as the elevation turret. 
The windage turret will usually be marked with reference points left and right of centre to aid you in making changes. 
This turret will also be calibrated the same way as the elevation turret with the same angular measurement system 
Barrel: This is also known as the tube and dictates what size rings you need to acquire. They are generally either 30mm 
or 1” (25.4mm) although there are others at 34mm diameter and some even bigger but the cost of these scopes is 
generally much higher.

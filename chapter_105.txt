How to adjust sights–

Vernier Sights (continued) 
The foresight may be a simple ring incorporating a fitting for an adjustable iris of different sight elements. If the sight is 
located within a tube, it is referred to as a “tunnel foresight”. The axis of the tunnel aligns with the axis of the bore. 
Within the tunnel, a foresight 'element' is fitted which is usually in the form of a metal ring, or transparent plastic disc 
with a hole drilled through its centre. The elements are designed to be swapped, depending on the range being shot. 
They can only be fitted in one orientation and some have horizontal reference bars to aid the shooter in horizontal 
stabilisation of the rifle if the range terrain undulates. Below are two forms of insert. 
 
 
 
Lining up the Target: 
The basic concept of how to use them is based on concentric rings. As long as you have plenty of white around each 
circle, the eye and the brain will automatically centre them. 
 
Make sure your eye is centred in the rear sight. 
 
Line up the foresight on the target. 
 
Make sure you are on the correct target number. 
 
Check the sights are level. 
 
Check all three again until they are all right.  
Remember, focus on the FORESIGHT. 
The image below shows a typical foresight/rearsight combination aligned on the aiming mark.

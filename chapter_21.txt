Bisley General Info 
NRA JustGo System 
You can log in via the NRA website and will then see the following: 
This is the main screen that has 
all your data at a glance. From 
here you can amend 
information like address, FAC 
status and emergency contacts, 
to name but a few. 
 
You can also add firearms by 
first clicking on the menu option 
MEMBER DETAILS, located at 
the top of the screen 
 
 
Once you have clicked “MEMBER DETAILS”, you will see 
this next screen. 
 
As you can see, there are a number of different sub menu 
options available to you. In order to record firearm usage 
you must first enter the firearm details. 
 
You accomplish this by selecting the “FIREARM 
INFORMATION” option 
 
 
 
As you can see, there are no recorded firearms to pick 
from so you must now enter a list of firearms by manually 
adding them. 
 
You do this by clicking on the “add” button to the right of 
the screen for each firearm you will use on the course.

Section 1 – Sighting Systems General 
Why do you need sights? – to hit the target! 
The most basic sight is probably the bead sight on the front of a shotgun. 
Without sights, there is little chance of hitting a target accurately at very short range and absolutely no chance of 
hitting a target further away. 
Sights generally are broken down into three categories: 
 
Iron or open sights 
 
Scope 
 
Reflex and Red Dot 
Irrespective of what sighting system you have fitted to your firearm(s), there are a number of steps you’ll need to do 
in order to make use of them effectively. 
The collective name for this whole process is referred to as “zeroing” and you will hear it mentioned throughout the 
course. 
Zeroing consists of the following subsets: 
 
Boresighting 
 
Theory of the Group 
 
Point of Aim 
 
Mean Point of Impact 
 
 
Let’s have a look through this process.

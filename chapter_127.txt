Section 2 –  
Minute of Angle 
MoA at ranges LESS THAN 100 yards (continued) 
We have already seen that 1 MoA is roughly equal to 1” at 100 yards and you should be fairly comfortable with the 
fact that as you increase the distance to the target, the distance between the legs of the angle increases 
proportionately. 
But… 
What about distances less than 100 yards? 
Let’s use the same angle picture used previously but in this case, substitute the longer ranges for those less than 100 
yards. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 MoA =    1/4”                 1/2”                    3/4”                     1” 
It’s the same angle, just closer. This fact is one of the biggest stumbling blocks when it comes to sight adjustment sub 
100 yards. Everybody gets a fixation on the 1” @ 100 yard = 1MoA rule and there is a real potential to use this rule at 
say 25 yards. 
If you fire a shot at 25 yards and the bullet strike is 6” below the target, going to default mode and applying  1” @ 100 
yard = 1MoA  and base that formula at 25 yards, you will only elevate your sights by ¼ the amount you wanted 
because you are at ¼ the distance (see above) 
Ammunition costs money and you could find yourself blasting away and slowly creeping up the target at a snail’s pace 
when a simple re-assessment of the range will dictate what the MoA value truly is. 
So, you’re at 25 yards and that bullet you just fired is still 6” below where you want it to be. Remember the 
relationship of the MoA at 100 yards? Well, let’s take that and use it in a little calculation to establish the inch value at 
closer ranges.

Minute of Angle 
So the range you’re shooting at is 25 yards 
so we place that in the equation 
 
The resultant answer comes to ¼ which is 
what 1 MoA is at 25 yards

So the denominator (the number below the line) in this case is 4 as we are at ¼ the distance (100 yards) and the MoA 
value is ¼ too. That denominator becomes our distance factor, explained on the next page.

Section 1 –  
Sight Systems - Boresighting 
Some boresighting gadgets 
Here are some examples of boresighting setups: 
 
This style is inserted into the bore at the muzzle and the idea is, you 
switch it on and a laser projects onto a target and you simply adjust your 
sights until they are on the laser. In theory, it’s a good idea except for a 
number of issues, the stem of the system has to be ABSOLUTELY 100% 
straight or the inaccuracy of the laser is huge, even at short ranges AND, 
forget to take it out, fire a shot and your gun barrel WILL be destroyed 
 
This gadget is inserted into the chamber of the firearm and the act of 
closing the bolt switches it on, projecting a laser beam down the barrel 
towards whatever it is you are boresighting on. 
Generally better design than the 1st item and no real danger of 
destroying your prized possession as it’s in the chamber. 
But, like all gadgets, it’s battery powered so will always run out just when 
you need it most. 
 
This design is known as a collimator and works by inserting a rod down 
the barrel (blockage!) and looking through the scope at a grid within the 
collimator to adjust your sights. However you need some point of 
reference first which means buying another format of bore sighting 
gadget prior to using something like this.

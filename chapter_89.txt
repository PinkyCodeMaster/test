Sight Systems - Boresighting 
Boresighting Fundamentals 
Before we start, let’s take a look at some of the fundamentals first. 
 
When looking down the bore, you should see something like this: 
The spiral effect you see is the rifling which imparts spin on the 
bullet and thus stabilisation which equals accuracy. 
Make sure the object you decide to use is unique or clearly identifiable. 
For instance, if you choose to boresight on a target which is exactly 
the same as all the other targets down range, there is a possibility 
that your bore is pointing at one target and the sights are pointing 
at another. The nett result is your elevation will be sound but you’ll 
be peppering somebody else’s target (see below). 
 
Remember Safety Rule #2 – “Always aim at your target” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Here’s a typical bank of targets at the NRA 
range complex at Bisley as an example. 
You’ll probably notice that they’re all exactly 
the same. 
If you look at the next picture, you will see 
why it’s vitally important to identify your 
chosen target when you boresight 
 
 
Which target is this boresight picture looking at? 
It could be Target 55 or it could be 43. 
Let’s look at it step by step.

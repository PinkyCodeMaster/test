Scope

Other Factors 
There is an increasing number of both high and low end electronic scope systems now appearing on the market that 
include useful features like range finding and programmed ballistic drop data that effectively alter the elevation based 
on the data you have programmed in. These systems are beyond the range of this manual however, and best advice 
would be to have a go with one before committing to the expense.

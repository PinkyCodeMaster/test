Red Dot Sights 
Red Dot Systems 
Other Reticles 
This market is awash with all sorts of variants with regards to what type of reticle to pick from: 
 
In terms of the description of the reticle style, it is basically down to the manufacturer and their naming conventions. 
As you can see from the image above, the term “red dot” is potentially misleading as some manufacturers offer the 
diode in both red and green (above). 
A good sight will have the ability for the brightness to be adjusted. This is essential if it is to be used in bright sunlight, 
If the red is to be coupled with an infra-red add-on sight system for shooting at night or in exceptionally low light levels, 
it needs to have the ability to adjust down, beyond the level the human eye can register but enough to be visible 
through the add-on. This is however, outside the scope of this manual. 
 
 
Benefits and Pitfalls 
There are a number of competitions involving fast target acquisition and these sights are perfect for them. Remember 
though that if you have a 6 MoA dot sight fitted to a full bore rifle and you are shooting at 1000 yards, that dot is going 
to obscure at least 60 inches of target, or 5 feet, or nearly half the target board! 
Another benefit of these sights is the position and distance from the shooter’s eye is not critical, making them 
especially attractive in hunting where recoil is generally greater due to the reduced weight.

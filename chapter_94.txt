Sight Systems –  
Theory of the Group 
Light 
Light conditions can also affect accuracy. Too dark and it becomes difficult to accurately place your sight system clearly 
in the centre of a target. Light coming in at your chosen position can also reflect back at you or directly into your eyes, 
causing errors to adversely affect your accuracy. 
Wind 
You will learn all about how to compensate for wind during Day 3 of this training Programme, suffice it to say that wind 
is a major contributing factor in longer range accuracy. As an example, a 20 MPH wind coming in from 90 degrees (right 
or left, doesn’t matter) at 1000 yards WILL blow a 7.62 bullet about 20 feet in the opposite direction. Yes, that is not a 
typo – 20 FEET! 
Other Conditions 
 
Adverse weather conditions - like light shining on a distant target can also give you problems with contrast. 
Snow can obscure a target, rain then sun will cause mirage 
 
 
Cheap glass! – a cheap scope will be constructed with cheap, poorly polished lenses. This creates a light 
scattering effect when the angle of the light is coming in from a low angle. The result is that it looks like you are 
looking into a bottle of milk. Good luck seeing through that!
